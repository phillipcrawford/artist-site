        <h2>Moving Toward Abstraction</h2>
        <div class="gallery-intro">
            <p>In 2019 my husband and I visited the Museum Frieder Burda in Baden-Baden, Germany to view a show entitled Der Blaue Reiter and one of the featured artists was Vasily Kandinsky. I developed strong affinity for Kandinsky especially when it came to color and the brush vitality of his work. Known as a founding member of the German expressionist group, Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Riders), he was also one of the first, just prior to WWI, to create non-objective painting. His is linked with Orphism, which differs from Cubism with its new emphasis upon color, using prismatic hues, to suggest movement and energy. The Orphists’ use of color attempted to model the way musicians use notes.</p>
            <p><em>"Of all the arts abstract painting is the most difficult, it demands that you know how to draw well, that you have a heightened sensitivity for composition and for colors, and that you are a true poet. This last is essential." – Kandinsky</em></p>
