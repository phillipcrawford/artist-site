    <h2>Welcome to the official site of June Safford</h2>

    <p>PHILOSOPHY OF ART <br>I refer to myself as a colorist. <br>WHAT COLORS? <br>My middle name is CRAYOLA <br>I’ve wrapped myself in color <br>Since I was old enough to choose <br>Ribbons, anklets, scarves.</p>
    <p>I came into this world and saw <br>No chasm between monochromatic <br>And monotony. Zing went <br>The flight of a vermillion cardinal <br>Neon in my gray midst.</p>


    <p class="left-aligned">Color is a tool that saturates my life with joy. I've recently come to know the early and later works of Wassily Kandinsky, a twentieth century Russian painter who chose to live in Germany, where I first encountered his paintings, whose treatise, The Effect of Color on the Spiritual in Art mirrors my having always believed there is soul in pigment.</p>
    <p class="inspiration-process"><span class="centered-header">FROM INSPIRATION TO PROCESS</span> <br>My life as an artist has consisted of sketching while traveling, attending figurative drawing sessions in town, workshops by well known painters in a variety of genres and places and, of course, self-exploration. I have always wanted to be called, Cezannesque for my attention to form, made more possible because of a strong background in drawing. My work relates to a need for beauty and central to beauty is not the adjective, "pretty," but rather a coherent sensitivity to practiced pleasure which comes from the simple art of both looking and imagining. Each day in my studio I see and try to follow a written prompt: "Every brush stroke has to have love and magic in it." – Picasso</p>
  <!--  <p>Someone once said to me, “You paint like a man!” I wish I had queried that person further but I have come to translate that opinion to mean I engage my brushes with strength, and with that I can agree. When I face a canvas I foreswear timidity. Of course that is truer following all the years I have stood in front of an easel. I began all of this standing while attending Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn, NY where I had signed up for an Art Diploma. After two years of intensive practice, drawing and painting, exploring many genres, I went on to self experimentation and very worthwhile art workshops, the most recent with Bozeman artist Diana Tremaine. However a tempera painting of brick buildings across my Brooklyn back yard when I was 16, informs me of my inherent passion for color, hence I refer to myself as a colorist.</p>
    <p>Three mentors to whom I ascribe inspiration have been: Vincent Van Gogh, intensive brush strokes, Cezanne, form and the use of expressive outline, and Kandinsky whose treatise: The Effect of Color on the Spiritual in Art mirrors my having always believed there is soul in pigment. My work relates to a need for beauty and central to beauty is not the adjective pretty, but rather a coherent sensitivity to practiced pleasure that comes from the simple art of looking. Each day in my studio I see a written prompt. “Every brush stroke has to have love and magic in it.”</p>
