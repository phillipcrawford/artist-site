    <p>The Mind's Eye
        Few people live in Montana.[1]  In 1951, when Clyde Aspevig was born, there were even fewer.
        Ably raised by parents who instilled in him a knack for being self-reliant, Aspevig early on began a
        lifelong relationship with the living land—an ever-present friend.  It is to this “stage where all our
        experiences take place”[2] that Clyde Aspevig returns repeatedly to reexamine it during every season and under every circumstance.

        Clyde Aspevig is occasionally described as self-taught.  While he did not go to art school per se, in the course of
        gaining a general liberal arts education Aspevig did indeed study art.  He might not go so far as those who ascribe no
        value to specialist art schools, but he knew that the direction he wished to go as a painter would not be encouraged
        in the atmosphere prevailing at most art schools.  He shared the view held by many artists that an ever-evolving
        intimacy with this chosen subject matter was the most effective education.[3]

        For Aspevig, that subject matter has been the peaks, shores, coulees, and forests that have
        formed the bedrock of his work.  Fast forward through his decades of experience, and what does the
        viewer now see in the wake of this artist’s aesthetic, geographic, and psychic journeys?  A
        progression is clear.  Aspevig today adopts a varying approach to the treatment of detail,
        selection of vantage points, subtleties of palette, and approach to composition.  An entire
        hillside might consume the foreground, or the viewer might feel herself wading into a cloud
        of brush … the younger Aspevig might not have dared to develop such compositions.

        He notes the dangers of becoming too comfortable with a subject.  On the flip side, he acknowledges
        the opportunities that a highly developed skill can give a painter, if that painter accepts both
        the freedom and the risk of aesthetic inquiry.  He can now combine his cache of memories with the
        images before him, analyzing both what his eye tells him and what his brain tells him.  The process
        is paradoxically both deliberate and unfettered.  These days, he sometimes “shuts off the visual mode”
        and experiments with pure form and accidental color in the studio.[4]  The result is a universe of
        seasons, colors, forms, and feelings … and, yes, boulders, ice, cataracts, the glint from a burst of
        spring leaves, and the blood-red shock of autumn.  It is indeed the land, but far more than the eye
        can see.

        In the midst of experiments that occupy him today, Aspevig’s wellspring remains the land itself, in
        its vastness and in its narrowest slivers.  There is an essential optimism in the act of revisiting.
        It reveals a deep-seated conviction that there will be continuing reward.  To see the work of an artist
        whose curiosity never flags is to see the visual manifestation of discovery.  Aspevig’s years as an
        artist cleaving to the land exemplify a recurring drive to arrive at the essence of something unknown,
        but significant, even as the artist’s ideas about that essence also evolve.  Nothing matters more
        than the land; yet, at the same time, the land is but a means to myriad ineffable ends.

        There is “an immediacy in being in the landscape, absorbing its uniqueness, light, terrain, coloration
        … all inspire a reaction.”  His goal is that the viewer “search the canvas” and take away at least a
        glimmer of the sensation of being in that place.  Regarding this goal, Clyde Aspevig has an extraordinary gift.
        The world is full of landscape painters, but few convey an understanding of the deep structure of the earth,
        its unnamable colors, and its animating liveliness.  Few can paint the very air.</p>
