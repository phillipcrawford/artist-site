    <h2>Welcome to the official site of June Safford</h2>

    <p>Someone once said to me, “You paint like a man!” I wish I had queried that person further but I have come to translate that opinion to mean I engage my brushes with strength, and with that I can agree. When I face a canvas I foreswear timidity. Of course that is truer following all the years I have stood in front of an easel. I began all of this standing while attending Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn, NY where I had signed up for an Art Diploma. After two years of intensive practice, drawing and painting, exploring many genres, I went on to self experimentation and very worthwhile art workshops, the most recent with Bozeman artist Diana Tremaine. However a tempera painting of brick buildings across my Brooklyn back yard when I was 16, informs me of my inherent passion for color, hence I refer to myself as a colorist.</p>
    <p>Three mentors to whom I ascribe inspiration have been: Vincent Van Gogh, intensive brush strokes, Cezanne, form and the use of expressive outline, and Kandinsky whose treatise: The Effect of Color on the Spiritual in Art mirrors my having always believed there is soul in pigment. My work relates to a need for beauty and central to beauty is not the adjective pretty, but rather a coherent sensitivity to practiced pleasure that comes from the simple art of looking. Each day in my studio I see a written prompt. “Every brush stroke has to have love and magic in it.”</p>
